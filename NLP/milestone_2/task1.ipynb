With benefits to include weekend’s free, company car with satellite navigator, and some of the industry’s highest pay scales, working for this company can be highly rewarding, both professionally and financially. The particular role is for a ‘Super’ Optometrist which is unique in the optical profession and is only available through this company. It has been developed due to the increase in the current number of home visits. As the services of a dispenser are usually not required, the company is able to pay the optometrist the allocated dispensing fee. It is therefore the combination of the standard sight test payment and the additional dispensing fee that makes the Super Optometrist one of the most attractive salaried positions currently available in the profession. Furthermore, as the average number of patients seen in a day is considerably less than seen in practice, the optometrist is allowed ample time for both professional functions.
